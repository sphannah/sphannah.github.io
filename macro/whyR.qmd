## Why R?

Using R is not a requirement for this course but it is recommended. It's a step up from spreadsheets (think digital rather than analogue) and coding is a useful skill to add on to your resume.\
\
To use R and RStudio without downloading anything, you can use [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/), formerly known as RStudio Cloud. This service allows you to run R and RStudio directly in your web browser, eliminating the need for local installation. \
\
**Here's how it works:**

**1. Sign up:** Visit the Posit Cloud website and create a free account.

**2. Access RStudio:** Once logged in, you'll have access to the RStudio environment within your browser.

**3. Start coding:** You can write and execute R code directly in the RStudio interface, just like you would on your local machine.

**4. No downloads:** The advantage is that you don't need to download or install any software, making it convenient for beginners or when using a shared computer.

Posit Cloud offers a free plan with basic computing resources, which is suitable for learning and smaller projects.
